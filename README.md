# Github-Finder-Hooks-Context

React app from Travery's React Front To Back 2019 course on Udemy. This is the same as the Github Finder app, but it is refactored using hooks and context. I did this in order to keep the two methods separate so as to compare them.

Note: There is a lot of commented out code because I am using this as a way to better understand how React works.
